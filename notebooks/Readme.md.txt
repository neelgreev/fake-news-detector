This project is a simple machine learning app that detects fake news using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing and EDA
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Deployed using Streamlit
- Pickled model and vectorizer

## ðŸ§  Future Plans
- Merge with more datasets
- Try better models (e.g., BERT)
- Improve real-world prediction accuracy

## ðŸ’» Run Locally
```bash
streamlit run deploymentModel.py
